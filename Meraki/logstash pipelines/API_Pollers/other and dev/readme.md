The Amp api logstash pulls AMP / IDS alerts from the Meraki API, the only problem is its from a network perspective, so theres no observer information.

The orgs file is one of the dev config files I used playing with the api.

I suspect the web hook functionality may be easier to deal with as well, but it requires a public end point, and will probably require the same level of org/network/device enrichment, but we'll see.
